Project Introduction: ChainPlay is a decentralized funding platform designed to support and promote game development through a unique approach that leverages Quadratic Funding. The project enables major corporations to create grant opportunities specifically aimed at fostering innovation in the gaming industry. Game developers can showcase their games under these grants, while everyday users, or backers, play a key role by funding the games they find promising. This collaborative effort determines the voting power and funding level each game receives.

How It Works:

Grants Creation: Large corporations initiate grant campaigns on ChainPlay to support specific game development projects, contributing to the growth of the gaming ecosystem.
Game Submission: Game developers register on ChainPlay and post their projects under active grants. Each game submission includes essential details like the developer's information, game title, genre, and media assets.
User Funding and Voting: Regular users explore the games under different grants and contribute funds to the games they wish to support. The voting and funding levels provided by users influence the standing of each game.
Quadratic Funding Allocation: At the conclusion of each grant, ChainPlay utilizes a quadratic funding formula to allocate funds. This method favors projects with broader community support over projects with high individual contributions, balancing influence across small and large donors.
Decentralized Storage: All data related to ChainPlay, including game details, voting records, and grant information, is securely stored on IPFS. This ensures a high level of data integrity, security, and decentralization, protecting both user and project information.
Impact and Vision: ChainPlay aims to democratize game development funding, empowering smaller developers and fostering community-driven support for creative ideas. The incorporation of IPFS enhances the security and reliability of the platform, while the quadratic funding formula ensures a fair and equitable distribution of funds.
